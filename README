Here is my setup of VIM as development environment for Python, OpenERP and Django and may be Lua. The setup is based on this excellent article:

http://sontek.net/blog/detail/turning-vim-into-a-modern-python-ide

I additionally integrated the following VIM modules:

- VimPdb (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2043)


INSTALL


cd
rm -rf .vim
git clone https://github.com/andreiboyanov/vim-config .vim
cd .vim/
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd bundle/command-t/ruby/command-t/
ruby extconf.rb 
make


In case VIM doesn't look for .vim/vimrc I put the following in ~/.vimrc

source ~/.vim/vimrc

NOTES

- If you don't have python and/or rubby support in VIM try to install vim-nox (at least this is the name of the package under Debian)
- To compile the command-t stuff you need the rudy-dev package. Just ruby is not enough.

Enjoy. :)
