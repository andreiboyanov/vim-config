Here is my setup of VIM as development environment for Python, OpenERP and Django and may be Lua. The setup is based on this excellent article:

http://sontek.net/blog/detail/turning-vim-into-a-modern-python-ide

I additionally integrated the following VIM modules:

- VimPdb (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2043)


INSTALL


cd
rm -rf .vim
git clone https://github.com/andreiboyanov/vim-config .vim
cd .vim/
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd bundle/command-t/ruby/command-t/
ruby extconf.rb 
make


In case VIM doesn't look for .vim/vimrc I put the following in ~/.vimrc

source ~/.vim/vimrc

# TODO - how to deal with VIMs compliled without Ruby support? It's needed for command-t

Enjoy. :)
